                            Different kinds of devices have accessibility to web and in the future there will be a lot more new devices
                            with different resolutions which will have access to web. The first thing to be done before making a website
                            responsive is to decide the target devices or resolutions. Not all devices that have access to web need to be
                            included as targets.

                    <li>Using Media Query</li>
                        <p>
                            Media queries specify the look of content by selecting the different styles based on media type and/or
                            features
                        </p>
                        
                    <p>A media query needs :
                    @media Media type and (Media feature) {
                                            /* Styles to be applied */
                      }
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        Media Type: Media type specifies the way in which the website will be rendered on different media. The media types supported are :
                        all, aural, braille, handheld, print, projection, screen, tty, tv, embossed
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        Media Feature: Media features are the constraints depending on which websites render different styles
                        when the conditions are satisfied. Listed below are the different media features available.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Commonly used are width, max-width and min-width. The available media features are : width, min-width,
                        max-width, height, min-height, max-height, device-width, min-device-width, max-device-width, device-height, min-device-height, index, min-color-index, max-color-index, monochrome, resolution, scan, grid.

                    <p>
                        Used in stylesheets:
                        @media screen and (min-width:600px) and (max-width:960px)
                        { / Styles to be applied when the condition is satisfied/ }
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>An inline example:</p>
                    <code>
                        <link rel="stylesheet" href="responsive/320px_to_767px.css" 
                        media="screen and (min-width:320px)and (max-width:767px)"/>
                    </code>
                                                         
                    <li>Using viewport meta tag</li>
                    <p>
                        Viewport meta tag is used to control the rendering of content  on mobile devices. 
                        Using viewport metatag
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        Without the viewport meta tag the mobile devices will not be able to calculate the device width and
                        hence won't fetch the related stylesheet.
                    </p>
                    <p>The syntax is:
                        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no">
                        <ul>
                            <li>width: describes the width of the viewport. It can either be set to a specific width or to device-width</li>
                            <li>where it calculates the width of the different devices accessing it.</li>
                            <li>scale: the scale properties in the viewport meta tag describes the zoom level.</li>
                            <li>initial-scale: The zoom level at which the user sees the page first.</li>
                            <li>user_scalable:  This property lets the user zoom the browser window. It can be set to “yes” or “no”</li>
                            <li>depending on which the browser’s zooming capacity is set.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    
                    <li>Flexible Layout</li>
                    <p>
                        Flexible layout can be achieved by using percentages instead of fixed pixels. em's should not be used
                        instead of percentages. em is a unit of measurement for typography which should be mainly used for fonts.
                        By using flexible layout the elements adjust their size to fit in the container holding the element.
                        Using of pixels will make web pages dynamic and the user will not be able to see the contents.
                    </p>
                    
                    <li>Flexible media</li>
                    <p>
                        It refers to media which responds and adapts itself to the layout/viewport on which the website is
                        being viewed.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        Fluid media can be achieved by :
                        setting the max-width of media to 100%: In this case the media will take the width of the container of
                        the media. Setting the width in percentage: In this case based on percentage value the media resizes itself.
                    </p>
                     
                    <li>Page structure</li>
                    <p>
                        Having a well architectured page will help in making the web page responsive: in a wide screen device
                        the page has different sections on left and right; in small screens, the right section falls under the
                        left.
                    </p>
